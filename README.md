# Repository made by Nathan Fuhrman
# Sprint 1 branch for the first sprint, we could do each sprint on a different branch and then pull the changes into main once we have finished each sprint. (I'm new to using git/github, but I think thats how this works)
# Note 1: We increased the allotted VB memory to 8 GB
